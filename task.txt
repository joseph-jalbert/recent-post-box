Hello,

You recently submitted an application on Indeed for the Full Stack WordPress Developer role at Adweek Magazine. If you're still interested in the position, we'd like to learn more about you and your skillset. To move along in the application process, we would love to get a relevant sample of your coding skill set. Below is a coding challenge we'd like you to complete and submit back to us. Once completed and reviewed, we will reach out to schedule a phone screening.

Create a WordPress plugin based on the following requirements:
1 Can be enabled/disabled via the Plugins admin page & includes full details for identification over other candidates’ plugins.
2 When enabled, the plugin adds a “recent post” box to the bottom of every article, per the attached design spec.
3 The “recent post” should pull the newest story from the site. It will be the same story on every article.

Notes:
• See the following files that illustrate the design spec at mobile and desktop viewports: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BycFCOATjTAhOEtPR0tVQlAyb3c
• If you are unable to retrieve part of or the entire post from the database then hardcode the information into html to style.
• Please use the specified fonts.
• The mobile version should become enabled at any viewport less than 728px. In between these viewports, the image size and margins should remain the same, with the headline portion constricting horizontally.
• Bonus points for using SASS / SCSS. Please include those files as well how you processed your sass.
• Once completed, please send us the full plugin in a zip file
